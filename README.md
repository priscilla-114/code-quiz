## Personal Comments & Contributions
I had started with one format of doing it and basically ended up starting over because I couldn't get the buttons to work on the quiz portion. You'll see that I forgot to commit during that period of duress. I followed along with a bunch of different tutorials trying to get the right fit but I think I cleaned it up decently enough before making my first submission. I am beginning to understand the functions and think I can read Javascript to know what is suppose to happen but writing from scratch is still something I struggle with. I hope to go back and figure out how to meet all the requirements. Thank you to [Xander Deanna](https://github.com/xander-deanna), [Michelle McConville](https://github.com/MichelleMcConville), and[GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-a-simple-javascript-quiz/) for giving me something to work with.
